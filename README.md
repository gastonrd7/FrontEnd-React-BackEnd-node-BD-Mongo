# challenge-participants-and-skills

Please install and run the api first. Follow your "README".
Then install and run the web second. Track your README.

Grades:
1- I decided to create 2 buttons:
Add Participants: to be able to load data into the DB.
getParticipants: this button asks for the participants and loads the grid.
If the page is refreshed, these buttons will no longer appear.

2-Do not use photoshop, create the components based on material-UI.

3-The grid that is "responsive" can be taken from many criteria, I did it in a way that I understood was correct.

4- I decided to make the skills section also "responsive".

5- I decided to use typescript on both the front and the back.

6-You can see an optimized logic of requests in the front, in case the "reducer" already has the information it does not generate a "request" again
